description: Implement tracker issue(s) in worktrees with parallel agents, TDD, review, and PR

# /task-implement — implement issue(s)

Take one or more issues from the configured tracker and drive them through the back half of
the harness (see `HARNESS.md`): `worktree → TDD → verify → review → PR`. Always
use worktrees, always use superpowers, always conventional commits. Multiple
issues run as **parallel agents**, one worktree each.

Requested issues (may be empty): **$ARGUMENTS**

## Tracker coordinates

Read these from `.opencode/tracker.md` (written by `/harness-setup`):
`tracker`, `mcp_prefix`, `project_code`, `project_id`. If the file is missing,
tell the user to run `/harness-setup` first.

- Project = `project_code` (pass `project_id` to MCP tools that need it).
- Resolve states **by name at runtime** via `<mcp_prefix>_state` (`action: list`):
  **"Todo"**, **"In Progress"**, **"In Review"**, **"Done"**. If your tracker
  lacks one (e.g. Plane has no **"In Review"**), create it once before running
  this command.

## Steps

1. **Resolve the work list.**
   - If issue identifiers were passed, fetch each by identifier.
   - If none were passed, list work items filtered to the **Todo** state, show
     them, and ask the user which to implement.
   - For each issue read the description and open the linked local spec under
     `docs/superpowers/` — that's the contract.

2. **Move each issue to In Progress** (`state` = the In Progress id).

3. **One worktree per issue.** Use the `using-git-worktrees` skill. Branch
   name = `<type>/<scope>-<topic>` from the issue's type + project labels, e.g.
   `feat/<project>-range-presets`. Worktrees go under `.worktrees/` (gitignored).

4. **Dispatch implementation agents.**
   - Use the `subagent-driven-development` skill; each subagent follows
     `test-driven-development` (red → green → refactor, full suite).
   - **More than one issue → `dispatching-parallel-agents`**: dispatch
     all agents in a **single message** so they run concurrently, one per
     worktree. Only parallelize issues that touch **disjoint files**; if two
     issues overlap a module, sequence them instead.
   - Give each agent: its issue + spec, its worktree path, the code map, "do not
     touch the main checkout or sibling worktrees", and "report back briefly".

5. **Verify (parent).** For each branch run
   the `verification-before-completion` skill: inspect the diff and run the
   full project suite. Confirm real green output before continuing.

6. **Code review (parent).** Run the `requesting-code-review` skill per branch.
   **Report findings to the user grouped by severity (Critical / Important /
   Minor) and ask which to fix — do NOT auto-fix.** Apply only what the user
   approves, then re-review.

7. **PR + close out — automatic.** As soon as a branch is **verified, green,
   committed, and clean** (no Important+ findings outstanding, full suite
   passing, working tree clean), **open its PR without waiting to be asked**:
   - Push the branch and open a PR with a conventional-commit title
     (`<type>(<scope>): …`), one feature per PR.
   - Move the issue to **In Review** (the PR is open, not merged); set it to
     **Done** when the PR merges.
   - The auto-open gate is the *only* thing that's hands-off: you still
     **report review findings and wait for the user to choose fixes** (step 6)
     before a branch counts as verified.

## Guardrails

- **Branch off the default branch; never commit to it.** Commit at green points
  so the branch is PR-ready, then **open the PR automatically** once it's
  verified, green, committed, and clean (step 7) — no need to ask. (Fix decisions
  in step 6 still wait for the user.)
- **Worktrees always** — implementation never happens in the main checkout.
- `.worktrees/` and `docs/superpowers/` are gitignored; never `git add` them.
- Keep parallel agents on disjoint files; sequence anything that overlaps.
